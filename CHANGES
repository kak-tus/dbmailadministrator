V3.0.2    
          August 30, 2016
          Converted to HTML5/CSS3 and removed some javascript speeding
          up the GUI. Minor tweeks.Install guide at http://dbma.ca
V3.0.1 (stable)
          October 1, 2015
          New Version for DBMail V 3.2.x plus -> Numerous minor fixes are
          needed but basic function is available. 
          TIP: Suggest once you are configured, change the option in the
          top of DBMA.cgi $RESTRICTGroupID = 'any' to 'your-main-group #';
v2.5.4    
          November 13, 2008
          * minor changes to give DBMA it's own main site dbma.ca
v2.5.3  
          October 18 2008
          * PGSQL bug fix
V2.5.2
          June 4, 2008
          * further changes made to PostgreSQL functionality to
            allow DBMail users to exploit the significant new 
            functionality and performance enhancements of 
            PostgreSQL 8.3.1 and beyond.
V2.5.1    May 12, 2008
          * substantial changes made to PostgreSQL functionality.
V2.5.0
          January 25, 2008
          * a few minor bug fixes including syntax management for 
            'SQL-illegal' characters in Auto reply Messages
          * reminders for configuring dbmail.conf to use AutoNotify
            and AutoReply
          * speed increase
V2.4.9    June 15 2006
          * This release contains substantial code modifications
            throughout.
          * DBMA is now more "Group-aware" as in groups 
            of mail users delineated by dbmail_users.client_idnr.
          * In the "My Groups" section of the Main window, the
            number of users in each group is set out when this 
            Configuration option has been turned on. Note that this
            is resource expensive and on large systems with many
            groups of users it can slow DBMA Main window considerably.
            (Working on that.)
          * A configuration setting is now provided to limit the
            number of users per mail group. In the RestrictGroup regime
            this would mean that the maximum number of users would
            be fixed and only a "root" administrator could reset
            the maximum once arrangements were made (i.e.: payment).
          * In the global configuration (full configuration authority)
            the maximum number of users per group is a healthy reminder
            that keeping unique client_idnr numbers to a manageable level
            is good practise. The default is set at 1000 per group.
            There is no limit to the number of groups.
          * Setting the Default Mailbox size now sets the maximum
            mailbox size for the RestrictGroup Admin mode
            This can only be overridden in the
            configuration window by a root administrator.
          * A bug which applied to later versions of Mysql has been
            fixed where in the case of a plain password being used,
            a space was injected into the encryption type field
V2.4.8    May 21 2006
          * Changes have been made to the allow_read_mail regime
            such that turning off the ability to read mail does not
            prevent the display of mailboxes in the user account window
            and searches can be done to locate messages even based on 
            message block content but selecting the message will
            return headers only and maintain the privacy of the message.
            This applies to DBMail Version 2.2 (Pending) and its
            precursor SVN Trunk and recent DBMail 2.1.x unstable.
          * Minor changes and updates to documentation
V2.4.7    April 18 2006
          * Further changes for the pending DBMail V2.2 release
            including incorporation of new table structure for
            dbmail_users: a step toward DBMA managing sieve scripts.
          * cursieve and maxsieve displayed in User Account Window
          * DBMA MTA Admin upgrades.
            MTA Domain Transport GUI has been completely overhauled
            and now more feature-rich for the management of 
            MTA virtual domains and transports.
          * If you use DBMail SVN/Trunk or if you use MTA Domain
            with Transport features, V2.4.7 is a must have. Upgrade is 
            simplified by typing perl update.pl in dbmailadministrator/
V2.4.6    April 6 2006
          * a mem problem with DBD-mysql-3.0002_4 required a workaround.
            Now that DBD-mysql-3.0002 is fixed, the workaround is
            dropped and LONGBLOBs are reinstated for DBMAIL 2.0.8/9
            dbmail_messageblks.messageblk to allow read and search mail
          * numerous minor changes prevent illegal search
            terms to cause a fatals_to_browser error message when the
            not-so-learned administrator searches for illegal control
            characters and such things (RFC2822 and RFC2821)
          * the Allow_Read_Mail function is now available for newer
            databases (even with older DBMail binary versions) where 
            LONGTEXT has been replaced with LONGBLOB
            binaries for dbmail_messageblks.messageblk 
          * a collection of little changes/improvements makes 2.4.6
            a "must have" if you are using recent versions of DBMail 
V2.4.5    March 26 2006
          * Further modifications and expanded mail read for
            DBMail Version 2.2 (current SVN Trunk)
          * Added back button to return to mail list for all versions
          * only minor change for STABLE versions of DBMail
V2.4.4    March 17 2006
          * User Mapping tool added. Applies to DBMail version 2.2
            currently at 2.1.x unstable and SVN Trunk
V2.4.3    March 14 2006
          * Update script update.pl preserves existing configs
          * New Installation defaults to "none" database type to make
            installation easier on systems with *only* pgsql and 
            no mysql client nor perl DBD module. 
          * "Database Cleanup" now defrags InnoDB tables/indexes
            for most of the main tables having many indices.
          * More data. InnoDB Free and RDBMS server time now displayed in 
            the "My Mail System" column while other two columns are
            lengthened to show more of the DBMail 2.2 data.
          * Continued doc changes as "Help" is overhauled/updated.
          * Fixed a missing tables Bug for DBMail old version 1.2.x
            where if database did not have the pbsp or other option
            tables an error message appeared instead of the desired data. 
V2.4.1    March 8 2006
          * This is the incipient DBMail 2.2 version.
          * Numerous small tech changes/improvements for Mod_Perl
          * Expanded DBMail versioning
          * Dropped config options for DBMail 2.1 SVN Trunk
            (DBMA Interimly treats SVN 2.1 as if it were 2.2.rel)
          * Dropped "use strict" for production releases
          * Added configs for pending release of DBMail 2.2
            (You can test on 2.1.x)
          * Added read mail option for DBMail 2.2
          * Updated Auto Replies for DBMail 2.2
          * Added start/stop dates for auto replies
          * Created groundwork for new DBMail Sieve config ++
            (Not implemented .. too early.)
         ** I like this. I don't know why the 'h' I didn't do it long ago:
            User Search feature now also searches aliases and
            serves an Account Window for the user having that
            email address (alias) if so found.
            This particularly favours systems where
            user account names are first_part (first_part@last_part)
            but applies to either or a combined environment of 
            "first_part" and or "first_part@last_part" user naming.
          * DBMA MTA Admin :: Domains and Transports is now able to
            take over and automate virtual hosting. After add
            an alias on a new domain, the MTA config is automatically
            updated and the new MTA domain is added as a destination.
            This relies on the extensibility of DBMail and Postfix
            compiled with xxsql.
          * A few enhanced installation aids workaround some
            typical (from feedback) Apache config mistakes and get
            DBMA diagnostics running enough to serve a diag window for
            those just starting out and who need to understand permissions
            a little better.
          * Help files updated.
V2.4.0    December 16, 2005 Minor Updates
          * HTML Form close error fixed on 'add alias' GUI for
            Group Admin. This obscure bug caused a 'missing data'
            error no matter how careful the typist.
          * Minor Java bug fixed which could have caused a script
            warning in some custom-configured versions of MSIE6
V2.3.9    November 25, 2005
          * a simple but annoying bug was fixed wherein, owing to 
            a recent ModPerl revision, a nested persistant value 
            for $transport was frustrating an MTA Transport edit.
            Where an admin wanted a non-standard value for the MTA
            Transport, the default could not be changed
            using the provided DBMA editor function.
            This bug only crept up lately and would not have
            impacted existing data but would have prevented
            changing the default "dbmail-lmtp:127.0.0.1:24" value 
            under most modern PERL environments (since 5.6.3).
            This MTA Transport feature is only functional if enabled
            in your MTA config. Please see Help to understand DBMA's
            MTA Admin features; drop me a line or visit http://dbma.ca
            to ask questions.
V2.3.8    November 16, 2005
          * Fixed a bug which applies to PostgreSQL in the edit
            mail forward routine. (Blank integer sometimes occurred
            [bad SQL] where GroupID was unknown.) This bug was
            ignored by MySQL but PgSQL rejected the command.
          * A few minor code improvements to xhtml.
          * Enhanced auto create alias function. This allows for
            amazingly fast creation of multiple users in same domain.
          * More intuitive user experience in some window jumps.
V2.3.7    October 21, 2005
          * Improved MTA Access
          * minor look and feel improvements
          * ModPerl 2 enhancements (dev)
V2.3.6   July 25, 2005
 	  * Maintenance and minor bug fix release
V2.3.5   July 2, 2005
          * MTA_Access feature added for PostgreSQL
          * Substantial enhancement of installation troubleshooting
            and sufficient function even with broken configs and
            file permissions to allow diagnostics to run.
          * Updated RESTRICTGroup Mode for new features and
            greater security, particularly on "forwards"
          * some minor bug fixes where httpd children retained
            nested values beyond a config change
V2.3.4   June 27, 2005
          * improvements to ACL functions, more intuitive window 
            jumps, updates to suit recent and retro PostgreSQL\
            versions etc
          * Access Control permissions can only be seen from 
            a global Administrator's login with ACList
          * allow deletion of __public__ and 'anyone' accounts
            in Group "0" to allow a 'start-over' of botched ACLs
          * minor GUI changes, more diagnostics in 'ConnectStatus' 
V2.3.3   June 18, 2005
          * added function for giving a domain alias to all users
            in a group (client_idnr)
          * enhanced system stats reporting and Connect Status
            Diagnostics added to Connect Status Error Handling
          * improved PostgreSQL interface
          * additional tweaks to DBMA MTA Admin
          * Cosmetic tweaks
          * bug fix where delete group alias was not returning
            to list
V2.3.2   June 14, 2005
          * Added tool for importing text-based mail access files
            like access, sender_access, client_access etc.
          * minor tweaks to DBMA MTA Admin
V2.3.1   June 11, 2005.
          * Konqueror 'textarea' bug workaround
          * More user config checks including permissions test
          * Upgraded Group / domain analysis
V2.3.0   June 9, 2005.
         * Significant release.   
         * BETA: Added Compatibility with HEAD and unstable 2.1.x versions. 
         * New features include more extensive MTA management.
         * Blacklist / Whitelist MTA Access capability to allow
           admin to add, change or delete 'REJECT', 'OK', 
           'reject_unverified' sender access in SQL table.
         * Table creation and management is fully automated.
         * Transports implemented with Destination Domains for
           per-domain transport functionality.
	 * Help Files updated and expanded
         * Increased number of user input checks including case
           checking.
	 * More 'user intuitive' links and jumps.
         * More options included in the User Account Window 
         * Look and feel improvements
         * a few minor bugs ironed out
V2.2.5   June 3, 2005
         * update to remove some test code left in minor .4
         * please make certain you 'chown' all DBMA files and 
           dir to the user and group of your HTTPD
V2.2.4   May 31, 2005
         * Some Old Browser Compat. issues resolved.
         * small enhancements to various GUIs
         * updated for mod_perl/1.999.23(RC6) Apache 2.1.4
           (also runs as CGI of course pr ModPerl 1)
         * better enabling of 'email address as user name'
           with more features
         * fixed forwards editing which broke in recent minor release
V2.2.3   May 5, 2005 
         * Fixed Clear function where DBMA disconnects from database 
V2.2.2   April 16, 2005
        * Forwards routine has been adjusted to alter a row instead
          of adding a row where the Admin has entered an existing
          mail address and a forwarding address. Mail from the "From"
          address will be redirected to the "To:" address specified
          instead of the Mailbox it is currently stored in.
        * A number of minor internal housekeeping changes including
          some connection management devices have been added or altered.
        * DBMA_help.htm has been updated.
        * If this is an update to an older version, please make 
          certain you 'chown' all DBMA files to the user and group
          of your HTTPD as a number of flat DB files have been 
          introduced since V2.1.9.

V2.2.1   April 9 2005.
        * Database Cleanup tool has been expanded to track down
          and delete orphaned messages existing in 
          dbmail_messageblks and dbmail_physmessage tables
          only and not referenced in dbmail_messages, 
          nor have a user in dbmail_users, nor mailbox in 
          dbmail_mailboxes.
        * A commit error has been fixed which prevented the manual
          addition of MTA domains with PostgreSQL Version 8 plus

v2.2.0   March 29 2005. Significant release.
        * NEW Feature: An extensive integration of Shared folders
          and Access Control Lists. DBMA automates the process of
          getting you started and then providing a fully
          integrated array of tools for flexible management of ACLs.
          You likely had no idea DbMail was so good at doing this.
        * NEW Feature: A 1st step in integrating MTA Administration.
          For MySQL and PostgeSQL, DBMA will generate
          an MTA database using heuristic learning to maintain in 
          real time an MTA-useable domains table which is auto updated
          whenever a domain is added to the system.
          Examples are provided for configuring postfix and other MTAs
          to point to the database & obtain the list of domains your 
          server is the final destination for. Sample configs
          are provided. Please read DBMA_help.htm from the Main Screen.
        * Autonotification management and Editing of Forwards are presented
          in a more intuitive fashion with a greater range of
          function including user input checking.
        * An experimental Auto-Reply management tool is available for
          LAN testing which may help in the further development
          of the function, or not. This is turned off by default
          and can only be configured in the Senior Admin role.
          (Pay heed to the nag warnings.)
        * User Account Window Expanded extensively.
        * Stronger error checking of user input. More data presented.
	* Allow Administrator to Access/Search/Read Mail now 
          configurable OFF/ON, hard-fast for Group Admin.
        * A few performance evaluators like Timed Mail Searches
        * And more fine grained improvements...
