SUMMARY
        DBMA (DbMail Administrator) For DbMail All Versions
                     *** PostgreSQL or MySQL ***


REQUIREMENTS: This package requires the following PERL modules.
   DBI and DBD for your database (i.e.: DBD::mysql or DBD::Pg)
   CGI::Carp      (Lincoln D. Stein's ubiquitous CGI.)
   Bundle::libnet (Graham Barr's excellent libnet.)

HOWTO use CPAN to install/update modules.
        > perl -MCPAN -e shell
   CPAN > install Bundle::libnet
   CPAN > install DBI
   CPAN > install DBD::Pg   
        -- or --
   CPAN > install DBD::mysql 

   Note: DBD-mysql-3.0002_4 has mem bug. Upgrade 3.0002_4 with *force* 
   CPAN > force install DBD::mysql

TROUBLE
** FIRST INSTALL TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES
1. Most installation errors are permission issues.
2. "./dbmailadministrator" *must be* writeable (777) by effective user
   because DBMA writes its own tmp files locally.
3. CGI files must be executeable (755)
4. Files should be owned by http daemon effective user.
5. ExecCGI directive must be turned on for "./dbmailadministrator" .

Don't Allow Public Access To DBMA
DBMA is a powerful administrative tool. Whatever secure 
environment you choose to do your enterprise or network management
within, using your own privileged user and permission sets, would
be a good place to run DBMA. SSL RSA256 is preferred.

DBMA runs with the dbmail-2.0.x and dbmail_2_0_branch of DbMail.
DBMA will run with 1.xx versions of DbMail with some limitations.

Note: If you already have DBMA installed and wish to upgrade without
losing your exisiting configs, use "update.pl" if you have 'wget'
installed on your system.

                cd dbmailadministrator
                perl ./update.pl


Manual Initial Installation

  1) Untar (tar xvf DBMA_SQL_V2.tar) the tarball
     from HTTPD document root or from your cgi-bin, as you wish.
     example: /usr/local/www/dbmailadministrator
	      /usr/local/www/cgi-bin/dbmailadministrator

              download tarball to /usr/local/www/
              cd /usr/local/www/
              tar -xvf DBMA_SQL_V2.tar

  2) chown files to your HTTPD user:group and chmod 755 *.cgi
     i.e.: chown -R www:www ~/dbmailadministrator/*

  3) With the sole exception of 'hard-coding' a "RESTRICTGroupID"
     mode (see below), all configuration is done from the GUI.

  4) Point your browser to /dbmailadministrator/

  5) i) If the programme fails to start, check that the shebang
     line (#!/usr/bin/perl) in DBMA.cgi points to your PERL and that
     you have the necesary modules installed. (See top of README.)

     ii) chown files to your HTTPD user:group and chmod 755 *.cgi
     (if you are very lucky the tarball's defaults may be fine.)
 
  6) make certain all files and directories are readable and writeable
     by the httpd user:group

  8) This package includes a maillog search feature for trouble
     shooting. dbma_logsearch.cgi doesn't need configuration
     as it will look for your logs or you can simply enter the
     location from the user interface. Make certain your maillog
     is readable by the HTTPD's user:group. Remember that Logs
     are rotated by crontab so permissions may need updating.

  9) DO NOT make this tool available to Public web access!

  10) Finished. Enjoy.

** The "update.pl" script included in the tarball will fetch and install
an upgrade of DBMA while preserving all existing configurations.
This script uses "wget" so you must have wget installed.
Simply type perl update.pl in the dbmailadministrator/ directory.


** Manual installation of Updates **
Untar the tarball (tar -xvf) from one level above your
dbmailadministrator folder, overwriting everything.
 -- OR --
If KEEPING YOUR CONFIGS is an issue,
from inside "dbmailadministrator/" do this:
cp DBMA_CONFIG.DB ../
cp DBMA_OPTIONS.DB ../
cd ../
tar -xvf DBMA_SQL_V2.tar
mv *.DB dbmailadministrator/

                   C O N F I G U R A T I O N
           Options Selectable from Configuration Window
###################################################################
                       *** OPTIONS ***

   OPTIONAL - Here's a method for cutting down the number of key
   presses when entering many new users. Just type the users name
   and DBMA will create the account.

   1 - You can set the default mailbox size
   2 - You can set the default domain
   3 - You can set your default Group ID (client_idnr)
   4 - You can ask DBMA to automatically create first email address
       alias using the username and the default domain
   5 - You can ask DBMA to generate the password
   6 - Notify the user of the password.

   These options can make many new user entries easier by
   having variables preset. if you are unsure, don't touch :o).
   Omitting a ' or a ; will break everything.

   If you complete all of the following options,
   creating a new user is a matter of typing the name.
   You can populate your database with a large number
   of users in very short order.

   Note about auto-password.
   DBMA will refuse to encrypt an auto-generated password
   until you have told the user what their password is. :o)

   (You can only alter the encryption type and password of
   auto-gens in the user modify form. By forcing plaintext,
   if you forget to jot down the password, it's still visible.
   You can always change it once the user is notified.
   Encryption in the database makes no difference to the user)

   The password DBMA auto-gen feature is a really good way of
   doing plain text passwords if 'clear text' is your preference
   because DBMA generates jibberish passwords which look like
   mush to a sniffer as compared to typical user passwords.


                      C O N F I G U R E
                    RESTRICTGroupID mode
#################################################################
This type of usage may not be for you. Do you have a Help Desk or
separate user group administrators?

After DBMA has been configured from the GUI, "root" can enable or
disable a very restrictive "RESTRICTGroupID" mode.

You must configure DBMA in your web browser FIRST before setting
DBMA to this "RESTRICTGroupID" mode.

** RESTRICTGroupID **

This option DRAMATICALLY REDUCES DBMA FUNCTION to a single group.
This feature also denies access to the "Configuration GUI" and to
all "Global Functions". The only way in which full function can be
returned is to (with root access) edit DBMA.cgi and comment out
the configuration setting which turns the mode on.

RESTRICTGroupID mode
          - hard codes the "Group" you specify
          - removes access to all Global Functions
          - removes access to DBMA Configuration GUI
          - restricts access to a single group
          - prevents duplicate user accounts across mail Groups
          - returns a notice and denies access if a search yields
            a user outside the restricted group

To enable RESTRICTGroupID mode you will need to open DBMA.cgi
in a text editor and uncomment the "$RESTRICTGroupID" configuration
setting.

ONLY IF YOU WISH TO RESTRICT ACCESS would you uncomment this
line and set the $RESTRICTGroupID to the Group you wish to allow.
When you open DBMA.cgi in vi or whatever text editor you choose,
you will see what is set out below. 

# $RESTRICTGroupID = '3'; Uncomment and set ...

You may also change $RESTRICTGroupIDName = " " to whatever real name
you would like, such as a domain name or a client name etc.
This will then appear in all pertinent titles and headings.

This mode requires that a unique implementation of DBMA 
be assigned to each Group (or customer) Administrator,
each having their own (.htaccess) password.

This configuration has a very wide range of applications.
Here's a hypothetical example. 

If you were to have 5 groups and 5 Group Administrators
(you may call them "field offices" or "customers" or whatever),
you would need to do something like the following with
your DBMA installations. (This assumes you are on the console, telnet,
XTerm or whatever as "root". In Win32 Windows or X Windows
(Gnome/KDE/etc.), drag, drop and rename to your heart's content.)

> tar xvf DBMA_SQL_V2.tar

            ** CLOSED CONFIGURATION **
RESTRICTGroupID "Group Admins" will not be able to adjust 
DBMA's configuration. 

Point your browser to /dbmailadministrator/ and change the 
configuration to suit your system and the specific Group use.

(This presumes you have your
DBI/DBD/MD5::Digest etc. PERL modules installed.)
DBMA will store the config data in a flat-file database.)

You can pre-configure the default domain, disable statistics
(Recommended), auto-create alias, Default mailbox size
and so on. You have a lot of control over how the Group Administrator
will use DBMA.


Once you are done configuring DBMA for Group use,
chown everything to the correct system user and group
(i.e.: chown www:www) and chmod 755 *.cgi,
just as you would do for a normal installation.

Now make unique copies of the works for each Group Administrator

> cp -r dbmailadministrator dbmailadministrator3
> cp -r dbmailadministrator dbmailadministrator4
> cp -r dbmailadministrator dbmailadministrator5
> cp -r dbmailadministrator dbmailadministrator6
> mv dbmailadministrator dbmailadministrator7

You would then have something like this:

/usr/local/www/dbmailadministrator3
/usr/local/www/dbmailadministrator4
/usr/local/www/dbmailadministrator5
/usr/local/www/dbmailadministrator6
/usr/local/www/dbmailadministrator7

... each package configured for your database. Nice. :o)

Next open DBMI.cgi in each directory and point $RESTRICTGroupID 
correspondingly to the correct Group number.

(For some recommended conventions on assigning Group ID's,
you might like to take a look at "DBMA_User_Management.htm"
contained within the DBMA tarball or visit http://www.dbma.ca/.)

The link for the Group 3 Administrator would then be something
like: https://thehost.thedomain.int/dbmailadministrator3/

The link for the Group 4 Administrator would then be something
like:  https://thehost.thedomain.int/dbmailadministrator4/
And so on.

( In a similar manner you could also build DBMA (in RESTRICTGroupID mode) into an
end-to-end secure and authenticated Web resource (authenticated SSL)
by which your external 'customers' or internal/remote 'departments' could
administer their own DbMail accounts. In the case where there are only
single known users of the resource you could easily use a self-issued
High Grade Encryption (AES-256 256-bit) server certificate if you don't have
nor want the cost of a 'store-bought' Server Cert (i.e. Thawte, VeriSign, SSL,
etc.). (http://www.ssl.com/ now offers an SSL128SCG2.5 single-domain
Cert for under $100. USD) )

Don't forget yourself. You should perhaps also install a
global (unrestricted) DBMA implementation for yourself or for
whomever you will designate as Senior Mail Administrator etc.

Remember to set unique passwords
( /usr/local/bin/htpasswd -cb .htpasswd user secret) and usernames
on your Inranet host  for each of your mail Group Administrators either
with .htaccess or (preferred method) in your Intranet HTTP Daemon's
configuration.

1) How's your PERL?
   Do you have Perl 5.6 with at least the following modules?
    DBI and DBD for your databse (i.e.: DBD::mysql or DBD::Pg)
    CGI::Carp   (should be in your PERL already)
    NET::SMTP   (part of libnet which should be in your PERL)
    Digest::MD5 (should be in your PERL already)

2) Is your web space enabled for CGI exec (see DBMA_security.htm)?

3) Note: If you can't get DBMA started in a config window you are
   likely missing DBI and DBD. Install them.

4) Have you configured DBMA with your Database details?

5) Have you correctly set the correct database type?

6) Have you correctly set the versioning for DbMail?

7) Do you have a database client (i.e.: mysql4.0.20-client)?

              Using ACLs and Shared Folders
################################################################
*ACL / ACL List*  
IMAP4 Access Control Lists (ACL's) (RFC 2086) provide the option to 
share IMAP folders. If you do not have any shared folders, this is your 
tool to create them. DBMA first checks your system to make certain that 
the critical system accounts exist within Group 0.

*Remember* that once you have created the infrastructure and assigned 
some administrative rights (SETACL) to key trusted users, your Shared 
Folder Forest under #Users is likely to grow fast. #Public folders can 
be controlled exclusively by you, the Mail System Administrator, or you 
can give Administrative Access Rights to #Public/folders to trusted 
users or Group Admins.

*How to Start Sharing Folders*
Select "ACL" from the main screen. Type the name of the folder you wish 
to create and press "Create Shared Folder." DBMA will do the rest. DBMA 
will assign limited user access rights to "*anyone*". If "*anyone* or 
*__public__* does not exist on your system, DBMA will create them for you. 

*The Global function screen for ACLs *also has an Access Rights tool for 
manually adding a folder to a users ACL or updating any user for any 
shared folder. Be careful how you use this as it is a powerful and 
highly flexible tool.

Any *User Account Window* provides a means to manage specific user 
access rights to shared folders. You can permit users to have higher 
privileged access rights or even administration rights. To understand 
these rights, hold your cursor over the text block at the bottom which 
corresponds to the item for which you seek help. Or click help. 

*Once you have your shared folders set up* and appropriate user rights 
assigned (for  *anyone*), you will want to get your email client 
configured to subscribe to these folders. The internet is abound with 
opinions on what is the best email MUA (Mail User Agent - Email Client). 
If you are using Thunderbird or a fairly new Mozilla Mail, you are in 
luck. These MUAs will "subscribe" to the shared folders in a flash. You 
can drag and drop or copy to, move to or whatever you like in these 
folders. 

*Here is a usage example of IMAP4 Shared Folders. *Let's say you have 
some pictures you want to show many people on your mail server. Create a 
folder or use what you have and create a message containing with your 
pictures and save it in your drafts folder with a subject line "Pictures 
of me Winning The Lottery" or whatever. Next, select the email in your 
drafts folder and copy it to your "Common Shared Folder". Now '*anyone*' 
has access. Hopefully your target audience is not using one of the ACL 
Shared Folders 'unfriendly' MUAs. You perhaps can share the following 
advice.

*With Microsoft's Outlook  Express* and Outlook you will need to do a 
little coaxing. Select the account and click on "IMAP4 Folders". Don't 
try to first subscribe to #Public after you "Reset List". Instead, 
select just the sub folders of #Public and subscribe to them. Close the 
"Folders" window. Reset the list of folders. Next open "IMAP4 Folders" 
again and select #Public. Close. This two-step process of subscribing to 
the subfolders first and then later subscribing to the root #Public 
seems to work. You should be in business.

*Sharing a Users' Folders
*This is normally done with an ACL-friendly MUA but DBMA can help you 
create much of what the user can do from their MUA if it is easier to do 
it for them than explain how; or in the event that your user has made a 
mistake and you are on a repair mission. 
I*n the drop-down display of available ACL-eligible folders in the User 
Account Window* you will see all of the "#Public" folders plus all of 
the users folders. They are all eligible for sharing.  Example for User 
Account Window for: Bob

            #Public/common 
            bob/INBOX
            bob/Trash
            bob/Sent
            bob/shared

*If you select and add a set of Access Rights to "bob/shared",* it will 
be available across the system under #Users but no one will be able to 
share it unless you assign Access Rights to additional users; or allow 
bob SETACL (Admin) rights for that folder and he can do it all for you.

*You manage individual user rights from the User Account Window* and 
manage #Public and #User rights from the global Access Control List 
Tools (select ACL on the Main Screen).
*Assigning rights to #Users/folder *can be done with the DBMA Access 
Control List Tools after the #User/folder has been shared from the User 
Account Window. The first step is to go to the User Account Window, 
create the shared folder by assigning the owner full Access Rights. Next 
you return to the DBMA ACL Tools and select the new shared #User/folder 
you created and one after another add the users need ing acces rights on 
this folder.

*ACL Permissions set to 1-On or 0-Off*
*lookup_flag*: mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB commands
*read_flag*: SELECT the mailbox, perform CHECK, FETCH, PARTIAL SEARCH, 
COPY from mailbox
*seen_flag*: keep seen/unseen information across session
*write_flag*: STORE flags other than SEEN and DELETED
*insert_flag*: perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox
*post_flag*: send mail to submission address for mailbox
*create_flag*: CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation defined 
hierarchy
*delete_flag*: STORE DELETED flag perform EXPUNGE
*administer_flag*: perform SETACL

*This Compares to the RFC 2086 - IMAP4 ACL extension definition*
The ACL extension is present in any IMAP4 implementation which returns 
"ACL" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY command. An 
access control list is a set of pairs. Identifier is a US-ASCII string. 
The identifier *anyone* is reserved to refer to the universal identity 
(all authentications, including anonymous). All user name strings 
accepted by the LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE commands to authenticate to the 
IMAP server are reserved as identifiers for the corresponding user. 
Identifiers starting with a dash ("-") are reserved for "negative 
rights", described below. All other identifier strings are interpreted 
in an implementation- defined manner.
Rights is a string listing a (possibly empty) set of alphanumeric 
characters, each character listing a set of operations which is being 
controlled. Letters are reserved for "standard" rights, listed below. 
The set of standard rights may only be extended by a standards-track 
document. Digits are reserved for implementation or site defined rights. 
The currently defined standard rights are:
*l - lookup* (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB commands)
*r - read* (SELECT the mailbox, perform CHECK, FETCH, PARTIAL,SEARCH, 
COPY from mailbox)
*s - keep seen/unseen *information across sessions (STORE SEEN flag)
*w - write* (STORE flags other than SEEN and DELETED)
*i - insert* (perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox)
*p - post* (send mail to submission address for mailbox,not enforced by 
IMAP4 itself)
*c - create* (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation-defined 
hierarchy)
*d - delete *(STORE DELETED flag, perform EXPUNGE)
*a - administer* (perform SETACL)

PASSWORD
========
NOTE: Please see DBMA_security.htm for Help with HTTPD Passwords.
Meanwhile the username is dbmail and the password is dbmail.

To generate your own password use the following adjusted to the
location of htpasswd on your system:
> /usr/local/bin/htpasswd -cb .htpasswd user secret

This is an administrative tool for real system administrators,
accessing your production (in-service) database. For some detailed
security considerations see DBMA_security.htm in this package.
Whereas we all seem to want to collaboratively govern network and
information security, it is the responsibility of the admin tool
user, no matter what the tool, to use and protect their
administration privileges properly. Any tool given to a Sys Admin
for system-level access needs security commensurate with
circumstance and environment. In developing this product I rely on
the three information security elements of tool design:
confidentiality, integrity and availability.

I also rely on the end user not to install this product on an
open web server and put at risk anything of value. I take no
responsibility for any action or consequence of any user of
DbMail or DbMail Administrator (DBMA).

DBMA_maketestuser.cgi
=====================
/dbmailadministrator/extra/DBMA_maketestuser.cgi

This is intended for early use in your installation and 
configuration process and very rapidly populates a new database
with randomly generated alpha-numeric users speeding up the
effort of creating a dozen or so users in a hurry. 

In DBMA, most of the create user data must be typed.

This tool invents test users in a hurry. 

You don't need to type anthing although you have the option 
of setting persistant variables like Group, Mail Quotas,
password etcetera.

The tool uses the 
/usr/local/sbin/dbmail-users utility and consequently
must be run on the DbMail host (upon which you installed DbMail).

You may need to adjust permissions for dbmail.conf and dbmail-users
while you use this tool. 

If you are unsure of what you are doing, please use the SQL tools
of DbMailAdministrator (DBMA). 
You can change the inserted values to what you like. 

All but the username and the domain will persist. 
This tool is primarily for testing purposes. 
A log of all users created is stored at 
/dbmailadministrator/extra/DBMA.test.user.txt

cron_fix_deletes.pl
===================
/dbmailadministrator/extra/cron_fix_deletes.pl

Please open this script in your favorite text editor and
configure for Postgres or MySQL as shown below
###############################################
my $DBMA_dbname     = "dbmail";
my $DBMA_port       = "3306";
my $DBMA_host       = "localhost";
my $DBMA_user       = "dbmail";
my $DBMA_password   = "dbmail";
my $sqltype         = "mysql"; # or pgsql
###############################################

This is similar to DBMA's 'Update Delete Status function' 
which runs a scan of the database looking for three basic problems.
1. messages marked delete by the client but status is still 000;
2. messages having no 'owner mailbox' and
3. messages unattached to a user.


This tool scans the entire database and where a message's
deleted_flag=1 will reset the status flag to 003 and in the case
of orphaned messages it finds it resets the  
message's status to status=002.

It will also check for and delete orphaned messages in 
dbmail_messageblks which are not in dbmail_messages nor have a
user nor mailbox.

You then have until the next dbmail-util run to review the changes.
(Look at the "Number of deletes pending:" column of the DBMA
statistics (Main menu) to observe any changes after doing
"Update Delete Status".)
