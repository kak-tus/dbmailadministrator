DBMA_maketestuser.cgi
=====================
/dbmailadministrator/extra/DBMA_maketestuser.cgi

This is intended for early use in your installation and 
configuration process and very rapidly populates a new database
with randomly generated alpha-numeric users speeding up the
effort of creating a dozen or so users in a hurry. 

In DBMA, most of the create user data must be typed.

This tool invents test users in a hurry. 

You don't need to type anthing although you have the option 
of setting persistant variables like Group, Mail Quotas,
password etcetera.

The tool uses the 
/usr/local/sbin/dbmail-users utility and consequently
must be run on the DbMail host (upon which you installed DbMail).

You may need to adjust permissions for dbmail.conf and dbmail-users
while you use this tool. 

If you are unsure of what you are doing, please use the SQL tools
of DbMailAdministrator (DBMA). 
You can change the inserted values to what you like. 

All but the username and the domain will persist. 
This tool is primarily for testing purposes. 
A log of all users created is stored at 
/dbmailadministrator/extra/DBMA.test.user.txt

Please open this script in your favorite text editor and
configure for Postgres or MySQL as shown below
###############################################
my $DBMA_dbname     = "dbmail";
my $DBMA_port       = "3306";
my $DBMA_host       = "localhost";
my $DBMA_user       = "dbmail";
my $DBMA_password   = "dbmail";
my $sqltype         = "mysql"; # or pgsql

This is similar to DBMA's 'Update Delete Status function' 
which runs a scan of the database looking for three basic problems.
1. messages marked delete by the client but status is still 000;
2. messages having no 'owner mailbox' and
3. messages unattached to a user.


This tool scans the entire database and where a message's
deleted_flag=1 will reset the status flag to 003 and in the case
of orphaned messages it finds it resets the  
message's status to status=002.

You then have until the next dbmail-util run to review the changes.
(Look at the "Number of deletes pending:" column of the DBMA
statistics (Main menu) to observe any changes after doing
"Update Delete Status".)
